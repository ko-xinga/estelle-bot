# estelle-bot
- This is a bot for my Discord server

# Requirements:
- Python 3.7
- discord.py (rewrite) 1.2.3
- pywikibot 3.0


# Things I learned doing this project
- How to interpret robots.txt
- Read robots.txt before you write a bot/scraper
- Use the website's API to request the data you want from a Wiki
- Querying API is tough
- There's no such thing as free hosting
